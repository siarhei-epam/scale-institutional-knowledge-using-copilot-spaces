# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

This README provides a comprehensive overview of OctoAcme's project management practices and serves as a central entrypoint for onboarding and ongoing reference. It also links to detailed process documentation within this folder.

## Project Management Processes Summary

OctoAcme's approach to project management centers on clear ownership, iterative planning, evidence-based decision making, and continuous improvement. The project lifecycle is structured into five key phases:

- **Initiation**: Validates the business need, defines measurable outcomes and success metrics, and ensures stakeholder alignment via a Project One-pager and communication plan.

- **Planning**: Breaks work into increments, defines priorities and acceptance criteria, estimates scope, sets milestones, and captures dependencies and risks in a risk register.

- **Execution**: Operates on a regular cadence including daily standups and weekly delivery syncs. Uses project boards to track progress, requires small, documented pull requests, and mandates at least one review before merging. Automated CI testing and linting are standard, with escalation paths for blockers.

- **Release & Deployment**: Features are released using standardized checklists, covering acceptance verification, CI/security scans, backup & rollback playbooks, and stakeholder communication.

- **Risk Management & Retrospective**: Risks are actively tracked and reviewed weekly. After each sprint or milestone, retrospectives are held to document learnings and actionable improvements, feeding them back into the process for future iterations.

**Core Roles**: Project Managers (coordination, risk, reporting), Product Managers (vision, backlog, outcomes), Developers (implementation, testing), QA/Testing (validation), and Stakeholders (input and approval).

**Communication**: Structured and frequent, with regular syncs and escalation paths to resolve issues. Quality assurance combines automated and manual testing throughout.
